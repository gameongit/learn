AWS Points:

#############################################################################
IAM:
1.A Policy can not be attached to a AWS resource directly, It can be attached to a User or group.
2. A Role can be attached to a EC2 instance through a Policy attached on it.
3. By default explicit Deny overrides to explicit allow rule.
#############################################################################
VPC: (Virtual Private Cloud)
AWS VPC enables you to launch AWS resources into a visual network that you’ve defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you’d operate in your own datacenter, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure
Of AWS.
A VPC is designed to resemble:
 - Private on-premise data centers
 - Private corporate network
A VPC is housed within a chosen AWS region and spans multiple AZ within a region.
This allows you to provision redundant resource in separate AZ”s while having them accessible on the same network(foundation of high availability and fault tolerant achitecture).

VPC Benefits:
1. Ability to launch instances into a subnet.
2. Ability to define custom CIDR(IP address range) inside each subnet.
3. Ability to config routes between subnets via route tables.
4. Ability to config an internet gateway to provide a route to the internet for resources launched inside the VPC.
5. Ability to extend your on-premise network into the cloud with VPN/VPG and an IPsec VPN tunnel.
6. Layered Security:
 - Instance level security groups.(firewall on the instance level)
 - Subnet level Network ACL.(firewall on the subnet level)

Default VPC:
In the default VPC, all subnets have a route to the internet via route table and an attached IGW.
Each instance launched in the default VPC (by default) has a private and public IP address (defined on the subnet settings).

VPC limits:
Each VPC has one IGW at a time.
50 customer gateways per region
50 VPN connections per region
200 routing tables per region / 50 entries per route table
5 EIP(elastic IP) 
500 SG per VPC
50 rules per SG
5 SG per network interface.
